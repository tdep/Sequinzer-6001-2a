## Sequinzer-6001-2a
It's the Sequinzer 6001, but improved!

This is a Flatiron School Software Engineering project for phase 2 featuring React.js and Tone.js to create a software instrument capable of receiving a 
set pattern and playing it back to the user.

My first attempt, (Sequinzer 6001) wasn't able to actually sequence, so I scaled back the project and build the Sequinzer 6001-2a. However, this version has a 
fatal flaw where the audio engine is not permitted enough time to buffer so after some time it loses the ability to produce sound. 

Future versions will address this and add other functionality.
